# Bias factorized, base-resolution deep learning models of chromatin accessibility reveal cis-regulatory sequence syntax, transcription factor footprints and regulatory variants

This repository contains code for the analysis performed in the paper "Bias factorized, base-resolution deep learning models of chromatin accessibility reveal cis-regulatory sequence syntax, transcription factor footprints and regulatory variants" by Pampari et al. Please refer to the details below for finding the path to the relevant analysis.

**We will be improving the documentation of this repository through the weeks. If you have any questions please reach out to anusri@stanford.edu**
