# Bias factorized, base-resolution deep learning models of chromatin accessibility reveal cis-regulatory sequence syntax, transcription factor footprints and regulatory variants

This repository contains code to make figures for  the paper "Bias factorized, base-resolution deep learning models of chromatin accessibility reveal cis-regulatory sequence syntax, transcription factor footprints and regulatory variants" by Pampari et al. Please refer to the details below for finding the path to the relevant analysis.

To download corresponding models, contribution scores and modisco objects for each of the analysis, refer to the synpase repository - https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn59449898/files/

**We will be improving the documentation and cleaning up this repository through the following weeks. If you have any questions please reach out to anusri@stanford.edu**
